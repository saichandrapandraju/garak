garak.probes.goat
=================

Dynamic multi-turn adversarial attacks using GOAT (Generative Offensive Agent Tester).

GOAT uses an Observation-Thought-Strategy-Response (O-T-S-R) reasoning framework
to iteratively craft sophisticated adversarial prompts across multiple conversation turns.
It maintains two separate conversation histories: one for the AttackerLLM with full reasoning,
and one for the TargetLLM with just adversarial prompts and responses.

Uses the following options from ``_config.plugins.probes["goat"]``:

* ``max_calls_per_conv`` - Maximum number of attack iterations per goal (default: 5)
* ``end_condition`` - Condition for stopping iterations: "verify" uses internal judge, "detector" uses primary detector (default: "verify")
* ``red_team_model_type`` - Generator type for the AttackerLLM (default: "huggingface.Model")
* ``red_team_model_name`` - Model name for the AttackerLLM (default: "Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507")
* ``red_team_model_config`` - Configuration dict for AttackerLLM (default: {"temperature": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4096, "hf_args": {"device": "cpu"}})
* ``custom_goals`` - List of custom attack goals to use.
* ``augment_custom_goals`` - Whether to add custom goals to dataset goals. If True, this will augment the custom goals with the HF dataset. If False, only the custom goals will be used.
* ``attack_hf_dataset`` - HuggingFace dataset path for attack goals.
* ``attack_hf_dataset_load_kwargs`` - kwargs to pass to HF `load_dataset` function.
* ``attack_hf_dataset_column`` - column in HF dataset to use for attack goals.
* ``num_goals`` - random number of attack goals to use (out of all goals from the HF dataset and custom goals (if provided)). If -1, uses all. 

Attack Techniques
-----------------

GOAT implements six sophisticated attack techniques:

* **Refusal Suppression** - Denies the target's ability to refuse by suppressing refusal strings
* **Dual Response** - Primes the LLM to generate multiple responses (safe/unsafe, generic/unhinged)
* **Response Priming** - Forces the target to start replies with specific strings to bypass safety
* **Persona Modification** - Changes the LLM's persona through roleplay or character adoption
* **Hypothetical** - Wraps violating requests in fictional or theoretical scenarios
* **Topic Splitting** - Exploits attention by embedding violating requests within safe contexts
* **Opposite Intent** - Tricks the target into responding with inverted or flipped intent

O-T-S-R Framework
-----------------

Each attack iteration generates:

1. **Observation (O)** - Analysis of the target model's response
2. **Thought (T)** - Reflection on the observation toward the goal
3. **Strategy (S)** - Description of the approach for crafting the next reply
4. **Response (R)** - The actual adversarial prompt based on the strategy

            }
         }
      }
   }


Detection and Evaluation
------------------------

GOAT uses the ``judge.JailbreakOnlyAdversarial`` detector for independent evaluation of target responses.
The probe includes an internal LLM-as-a-judge using the JailbreakBench classification prompt for early stopping, but the final detection is performed independently by the detector after all attempts are complete.

The probe automatically stops early when the internal judge detects a successful jailbreak, minimizing unnecessary API calls. Each attempt includes detailed notes:

* ``attack_goal`` - The per-attempt attack objective being tested
* ``is_adversarial`` - Boolean indicating if this is the final turn for evaluation
* ``early_stop_reasonings`` - Internal judge's reasoning per output (optional, for debugging)

Turn number is tracked on each ``Conversation`` object's notes (``conversation.notes["turn"]``).
